        sexually assaulting her (16F) friend (17F). She''s known her just over a year
        so I''ve known her for the same amount of time. \n\nShe tried to kiss me,
        I turned her down and as a result she accused me of raping her. It went on
        for a few weeks and even went to the police and it only came out when they
        were grilling her and she finally admitted it. She was assaulted but it was
        her mum''s boyfriend and she went with accusing me because I was the \"safe\"
        option or some shit like that. \n\nWhen my daughter found out at the time
        and I was being investigated though, she cut me off. Basically didn''t even
        want to talk to me or see me - I tried to pick her up to come over but she
        said she didn''t even want to see me. My ex wouldn''t even let me in the house
        (even she believed it) and her brother/my ex BIL physically assaulted me and
        removed me from the house because I wouldn''t go until I seen my daughter.
        Worst thing was, she blocked me on social media but before she did she put
        a status on her social media just saying some bollocks like \"Believe women\".
        Which fucking hurt - In my daughter''s eyes, I was a rapist and I assaulted
        her friend.\n\nSo now it''s all came out and I''m cleared, she rang me up
        to say she wants to come over to talk but I said no - I don''t think it''s
        a good idea, it hurt me when she didn''t believe me so I want to just think
        for a bit until I forgive her. My ex then rang saying how hurt my daughter
        is because I won''t forgive her - she tried to apologise too and I told her
        I don''t accept her apology either and that I don''t want to talk to her either.
        \n\nThey''re not stopping texting me though and my daughter tried to come
        over and was banging my door asking to come in crying. I pretended I wasn''t
        in. \n\nAITAH for wanting some space because I don''t know if I can forgive
        her yet?\n\nEdited to add because people keep on asking \"why were you alone
        with a 17 year old.\" I wasn''t really \"alone\" with her. They were both
        staying at my house, I went for a wee in the middle of the night and she was
        waiting outside the toilet door and scared me a bit coming out. I laughed
        it off and she basically lunged trying to kiss me. I laughed it off, told
        her no and went back to bed. I didn''t really pay it any more attention and
        truth be told, forgot about it.\n\nUPDATE \n\nI''ve messaged her saying basically
        I''m still too hurt to want to talk and I need time and space and that I''ll
        let her know when I want to get in touch. I also said I still love her (despite
        not really being sure if I should say that when I am not sure if I can forgive
        yet).\n\nI''ve also messaged my ex saying to make sure she or my daughter
        don''t contact me again until I''m ready. Not heard anything back yet but
        hopefully I won''t.\n\nSomeone on here (can''t remember who, sorry) said I
        should look into a holiday which really isn''t a bad idea so I''m currently
        looking into places I can go for a week or so and might book some time off

        "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically
        I (41M) was accused of sexually assaulting her (16F) friend (17F). She&amp;#39;s
        known her just over a year so I&amp;#39;ve known her for the same amount of
        time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tried to kiss me, I turned her down and as
        a result she accused me of raping her. It went on for a few weeks and even
        went to the police and it only came out when they were grilling her and she
        finally admitted it. She was assaulted but it was her mum&amp;#39;s boyfriend
        and she went with accusing me because I was the &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; option
        or some shit like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When my daughter found out
        at the time and I was being investigated though, she cut me off. Basically
        didn&amp;#39;t even want to talk to me or see me - I tried to pick her up
        to come over but she said she didn&amp;#39;t even want to see me. My ex wouldn&amp;#39;t
        even let me in the house (even she believed it) and her brother/my ex BIL
        physically assaulted me and removed me from the house because I wouldn&amp;#39;t
        go until I seen my daughter. Worst thing was, she blocked me on social media
        but before she did she put a status on her social media just saying some bollocks
        like &amp;quot;Believe women&amp;quot;. Which fucking hurt - In my daughter&amp;#39;s
        eyes, I was a rapist and I assaulted her friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So
        now it&amp;#39;s all came out and I&amp;#39;m cleared, she rang me up to say
        she wants to come over to talk but I said no - I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s
        a good idea, it hurt me when she didn&amp;#39;t believe me so I want to just
        think for a bit until I forgive her. My ex then rang saying how hurt my daughter
        is because I won&amp;#39;t forgive her - she tried to apologise too and I
        told her I don&amp;#39;t accept her apology either and that I don&amp;#39;t
        want to talk to her either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re not stopping
        texting me though and my daughter tried to come over and was banging my door
        asking to come in crying. I pretended I wasn&amp;#39;t in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITAH
        for wanting some space because I don&amp;#39;t know if I can forgive her yet?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited
        to add because people keep on asking &amp;quot;why were you alone with a 17
        year old.&amp;quot; I wasn&amp;#39;t really &amp;quot;alone&amp;quot; with
        her. They were both staying at my house, I went for a wee in the middle of
        the night and she was waiting outside the toilet door and scared me a bit
        coming out. I laughed it off and she basically lunged trying to kiss me. I
        laughed it off, told her no and went back to bed. I didn&amp;#39;t really
        pay it any more attention and truth be told, forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE
        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve messaged her saying basically I&amp;#39;m
        still too hurt to want to talk and I need time and space and that I&amp;#39;ll
        let her know when I want to get in touch. I also said I still love her (despite
        not really being sure if I should say that when I am not sure if I can forgive
        yet).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also messaged my ex saying to make
        sure she or my daughter don&amp;#39;t contact me again until I&amp;#39;m ready.
        Not heard anything back yet but hopefully I won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone
        on here (can&amp;#39;t remember who, sorry) said I should look into a holiday
        which really isn&amp;#39;t a bad idea so I&amp;#39;m currently looking into
        places I can go for a week or so and might book some time off work. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

        a situation, and I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m the bad guy here.
        I\u2019ll try to keep this short, but there\u2019s some context that might
        be important.\n\nSo, my (34M) wife (32F) and I have been married for 7 years.
        We\u2019ve had a pretty great life together\u2014I\u2019ve built a successful
        business (I do pretty well for myself, I\u2019ll leave it at that) and we\u2019ve
        traveled all over the world, live in a beautiful house, the whole deal. I\u2019ve
        always thought we were happy.\n\nOut of nowhere a few months ago, my wife
        tells me she wants to \"open up\" our marriage. Her reasoning was that we
        were \"missing out on experiences\" and she wanted to explore her options,
        but she made it clear she still loved me and didn\u2019t want to break up.
        I was blindsided. We\u2019ve never had issues with intimacy or connection,
        and honestly, I\u2019m in great shape, I\u2019ve always been attentive to
        her needs, and I just didn\u2019t see it coming.\n\nAt first, I was against
        the idea, but then I figured, okay, why not see what happens? If this is what
        she wants, I\u2019m not going to stop her. I agreed to give it a try, but
        with the condition that it goes both ways\u2014if she\u2019s out meeting other
        guys, I\u2019m going to meet other women too.\n\nWell, here\u2019s where things
        get a little... ironic. As soon as we \u201copened\u201d the relationship,
        I started meeting women left and right. I\u2019m talking crazy success on
        dating apps, people I meet through work, even casual flings while I\u2019m
        traveling for business. Turns out, being wealthy, fit, and confident tends
        to attract a lot of attention. I\u2019ll spare you the details, but let\u2019s
        just say I haven\u2019t exactly been lonely.\n\nMy wife, on the other hand?
        Yeah... not so much. She\u2019s been on a few dates, but nothing\u2019s really
        panned out for her. A couple of the guys ghosted her, and she\u2019s mostly
        frustrated that it\u2019s not what she imagined. Meanwhile, I\u2019m having
        a blast.\n\nAfter a few months of this, I started to realize that I don\u2019t
        need to stay in a marriage where my wife was basically looking for an excuse
        to cheat on me. If she wanted to be single, then let\u2019s make it official.
        I filed for divorce, and now she\u2019s upset and saying that I\u2019m \"punishing
        her\" for wanting to explore herself, but honestly, I just don\u2019t see
        the point in staying married if we\u2019re both dating other people. Why play
        house?\n\nSo now she\u2019s telling our friends that I\u2019m being selfish
        and that I\u2019m only divorcing her because she\u2019s not having as much
        \"success\" as I am in this open thing, which is absolutely not the case.
        I just think we\u2019re on different paths now, and I\u2019ve realized I don\u2019t
        need to stick around when I can literally have my cake and eat it too.\n\nAITA
        for filing for divorce? Or should I have tried harder to make her feel better
        about a situation she basically created?\n\n  \nEDIT: To clarify, I didn\u2019t
        start having fun out of spite\u2014I genuinely went into this thinking it
        could work, but it just opened my eyes to the fact that we want different
        things. Also, the divorce isn\u2019t about her \"failing\" at the open relationship,
        it\u2019s about me realizing I don\u2019t want this life with her anymore.",

        good, knew the right questions to ask, and the kid admitted to her what had
        been happening. Unfortunately, I was correct, and she told the social worker
        it was her dad. Her mother knew. Her mother allowed it. \n\nThey were arrested.

        upset and distraught that her sister was allowing that to happen to her own
        child, and that the kid has been suffering for at least 6 months. My wife
        is not mad that I called, she is grateful. She admitted to being blind to
        the situation and she is very upset with herself because of it. My wife can
        be a bit naive sometimes, she assumed the best in her sister, she is not a
        bad person.\n\nAs for the kid, she is safe with us and doing okay. She always
        told my wife she wanted to live here so she is happy for now. Just in the

        "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted my original
        post a few days ago and a few people asked for an update out of concern for
        the kid. I called CPS shortly after posting that. They sent a well check over
        pretty quickly after what I described. A social worker was involved. She apparently
        was really good, knew the right questions to ask, and the kid admitted to
        her what had been happening. Unfortunately, I was correct, and she told the
        social worker it was her dad. Her mother knew. Her mother allowed it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They
        were arrested. The kid was taken in for a while but now she is with us. My
        wife is completely upset and distraught that her sister was allowing that
        to happen to her own child, and that the kid has been suffering for at least
        6 months. My wife is not mad that I called, she is grateful. She admitted
        to being blind to the situation and she is very upset with herself because
        of it. My wife can be a bit naive sometimes, she assumed the best in her sister,
        she is not a bad person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the kid, she is safe
        with us and doing okay. She always told my wife she wanted to live here so
        she is happy for now. Just in the past few days she has gotten a bit warmed
        up to me. I am hoping she is going to be okay. She asked me to hold that stuffed
        cat yesterday, so that&amp;#39;s something, I think. We are working with a
        lot of professionals for her. Thanks for the response the first time around.

        going on with my brother (30M) and his fiance Amara (29F). To give some context,
        I\u2019ve been sober for about 4 years now, but in my early twenties, I struggled
        with alcohol and drugs. It was a really dark time for me, and I worked *hard*
        to get to where I am now. My brother has always been super supportive, but
        Amara... not so much.\n\nAt first, it was little things that I tried to ignore.
        At family dinners, she''d say things like \u201coh better keep the wine bottle
        away from \\[my name\\]!\u201d and laugh like it was funny. I didn\u2019t
        want to make a big deal out of it, so I just kind of awkwardly smiled and
        moved on. But then it started happening more and more.\n\nA couple of months
        ago, we were all out at a restaurant with friends, and Amara made a joke about
        how \"if we run out of booze at the wedding, we\u2019ll know who drank it
        all.\" It was *so* embarrassing. Everyone kind of laughed, but it was that
        awkward, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u201d kind of laugh. I felt sick.\n\nI
        ended up talking to her after that, trying to explain how much those comments
        hurt, and she just rolled her eyes and said I was being too sensitive, that
        it was just a joke. But it doesn\u2019t feel like a joke to me. My sobriety
        is such a huge part of my life and it\u2019s not something I\u2019m ashamed
        of, but when she makes those comments, I feel like all the hard work I\u2019ve
        done just gets reduced to being the \u201cdrunk\u201d in the room.\n\nThe
        worst part was last week. We were talking about wedding plans and she made
        another comment, something like, \u201cAre you sure you can handle the open
        bar? Or should we get a babysitter for you?\u201d I just... I couldn\u2019t
        take it. My brother was there and didn\u2019t say *anything.* I left because
        I was so mad, but also hurt that my own brother wouldn\u2019t defend me.\n\nI
        tried to talk to him about it afterward, and while he admits that Amara''s
        jokes are out of line, he keeps saying it\u2019s \"just her sense of humor\"
        and that I need to let it go. He says she doesn\u2019t mean it \"in a bad
        way\" and that I\u2019m overreacting.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I am. I\u2019m
        at the point where I really don\u2019t want to go to their wedding. I know
        it\u2019s his big day and all, but I can\u2019t imagine being there, sitting
        at a table, knowing Amara\u2019s going to make more comments, and feeling
        like I\u2019m the joke. When I told my brother this, he got super upset, saying
        I was going to ruin the wedding and that family comes first.\n\nSo, now I
        don\u2019t know what to do. I love my brother. I don\u2019t think I should
        have to suck it up and be miserable just to keep the peace.\n\nAITA for thinking

        It wasn''t actually very much, but I was hurt. \n\nDDay was hard. I had taken
        my kid to try and catch a bit of the Perseid meteor shower. It turned out
        to be too cloudy, and we didn''t stay out long. I put our kid to bed and she
        was obviously annoyed that we came back. I sat down at the computer to do
        something, and there was a browser window open but minimized. I clicked on
        it It was a website that catered to people who were having and looking for
        affairs. She had a profile. There were dozens of encounters. I was absolutely
        reeling. I sat there staring scrolling and clicking for an hour or so. I stumbled
        into our bedroom and confronted her. She denied it at first, but there was
        too much. I didn''t take it well. I didn''t leave, but I moved to the guest
        room.\n\nWhat happened over the next few months....I''m not proud of. I did
        everything wrong. I did everything I could to try and save my marriage. I
        humiliated and debased myself trying to fix things. The trickle truth lasted
        for months. The cheating had started as soon as I left for basic training
        and had lasted for the entirety of our marriage. She had my complete trust
        over the years, and leveraged that to avoid being caught for over 20 years.\n\nThe
        trickle truth came out over the following months. She had triple digit affair
        partners over the years. She hid it from me all that time.\n\nShe started
        hooking up again while I was desperately trying to fix things. She left me
        via a text message.\n\nIn the divorce, she just wanted cash. She had moved
        in with current AP and had started doing drugs. I ended up with full custody,
        she got all of our savings and alimony. She paid no child support.\n\nAbout
        a year later, she moved to a different city. A few months later she wanted
        our kid to come visit her. I agreed and even made the drive for the hand off.
        When I went to pick up our child a few days later. He told me she living with
        someone, and was using his last name. Cohabitating was grounds for ending
        alimony.\n\nI sued to end the alimony. She did show up for that hearing. She
        took the stand herself and said that yes she was doing everything that my
        complaint said she was doing, which the state said was a legal reason to end
        alimony, but that she didn''t think it was fair to do so. It was a short trial
        that ended right then. I won.\n\nBut the judge admonished me. He told me he
        remembered our divorce and that he had considered our divorce decree to have
        been lopsided in my favor and had considered not granting it. He didn''t want
        to settle this in my favor, but her testimony had left him with no choice.\n\nIt''s
        always bothered me that the judge reprimanded me. I''ve always tried to live
        right and be fair. I feel justified, but that little nagging voice in the
        back of my head has always left me wondering.\n\nAm I the asshole for suing

        started hooking up again while I was desperately trying to fix things. She
        left me via a text message.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the divorce, she just
        wanted cash. She had moved in with current AP and had started doing drugs.
        I ended up with full custody, she got all of our savings and alimony. She
        paid no child support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a year later, she moved
        to a different city. A few months later she wanted our kid to come visit her.
        I agreed and even made the drive for the hand off. When I went to pick up
        our child a few days later. He told me she living with someone, and was using
        his last name. Cohabitating was grounds for ending alimony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
        sued to end the alimony. She did show up for that hearing. She took the stand
        herself and said that yes she was doing everything that my complaint said
        she was doing, which the state said was a legal reason to end alimony, but
        that she didn&amp;#39;t think it was fair to do so. It was a short trial that
        ended right then. I won.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the judge admonished me.
        He told me he remembered our divorce and that he had considered our divorce
        decree to have been lopsided in my favor and had considered not granting it.
        He didn&amp;#39;t want to settle this in my favor, but her testimony had left
        him with no choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s always bothered me
        that the judge reprimanded me. I&amp;#39;ve always tried to live right and
        be fair. I feel justified, but that little nagging voice in the back of my
        head has always left me wondering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I the asshole
        for suing my ex to end the alimony we agreed on after she broke the terms
        written in our divorce decree?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

        items. \nDuring my grandma&amp;#39;s stay, she dropped a bottle of red tomato
        sauce on my $230 rug and didn&amp;#39;t clean it up until I got home four
        hours later. She broke the glass top of my vanity, damaged my $309 Jordans,
        and messed up most of my expensive makeup. Just to clarify, my grandma has
        no medical issues; her mind is completely sharp. I could understand if she
        had problems, but she doesn\u2019t\u2014she is healthy.\nSo before she left,
        I made a list of all the things she damaged while staying in my room. My grandma
        and my mom yelled at me, called me names, and said that I could replace the
        items myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null,

        is 29. We\u2019ve been together for four years, and our anniversary was last
        weekend. It wasn\u2019t a big milestone or anything, but it\u2019s still our
        anniversary, so I figured we\u2019d do something nice together. We had made
        loose plans to go out for dinner and spend the day together, nothing fancy,
        just time for the two of us.\n\nTwo days before, Matt tells me his friends
        are planning a last-minute weekend trip to the mountains. They were going
        to go hiking and camping, and he asked if I\u2019d be cool with him joining
        them instead of sticking to our plans. I didn\u2019t really know how to respond
        at first. I was kind of shocked that he\u2019d even consider going away with
        his friends on our anniversary, but I didn\u2019t want to be the girlfriend
        who says no to everything, you know?\n\nThe relationship has honestly been
        amazing. We\u2019ve never had major issues, and he\u2019s always been thoughtful
        and loving. I have no intention of leaving him over this, but I\u2019m just
        taken aback and don\u2019t know how to confront him because something like
        this has never happened before.\n\nI told him I\u2019d been looking forward
        to spending the day together and that it hurt that he wanted to bail on something
        that felt important to me. He shrugged and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a day,
        we can go out another time,\u201d and that his friends had already organized
        everything. I tried to explain that I wasn\u2019t asking for much, just for
        us to celebrate our relationship on the actual day. I thought he\u2019d get
        it, but he brushed it off, saying I was being \u201cdramatic\u201d and that
        I was making a big deal out of nothing.\n\nIn the end, he went on the trip.
        He left the morning of our anniversary and didn\u2019t even check in with
        me. No texts, no calls. I spent the entire day feeling hurt and honestly questioning
        where I stand in this relationship. I tried distracting myself by hanging
        out with friends, but all I could think about was how he chose them over me
        on what\u2019s supposed to be a special day for us.\n\nWhen he got back, he
        acted like nothing happened. I told him how upset I was, but he doubled down,
        saying I was overreacting and that we could celebrate any time. He said I
        was making it about me and that he rarely gets to see his friends, so I should
        understand. I don\u2019t want to be controlling, but I thought our anniversary
        would be a priority for him, even if it\u2019s just a small celebration.\n\nNow
        I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong for being this upset.
        Maybe it\u2019s not as big a deal as I thought, but it feels like I should
        matter more, right?\n\nAITA for being upset that my boyfriend ditched me for

        The issue is my mom''s boyfriend doesn''t work, he''s home 24/7 and still

        the eldest (17, he is the one with the least issues, he is healthy enough

        escalated a week ago, I was exhausted after work and saw that once again there
        was no toilet paper in the mess that is our bathroom. I messaged the family

        and 4F). \n\nI have a an older brother named Toby (39M) and a younger sister
        named Quinn (35F). I was incredibly close with Quinn growing up, and she was
        a sweet and sensitive little girl, and so I think I''m especially protective
        of her. I don''t think she needs my protection though because Quinn is a total
        kick ass. She was a DI college swimmer and is now a successful attorney. I''m
        so proud of her and known she can stick up for herself, but she''s still my
        little sister in my eyes, and I have a strong impulse to look out for her.\n\nWhen
        Quinn was a freshman in college, she came out as a lesbian. We''d gone to
        Catholic school our whole lives and were raised by conservative(ish) parents
        who had probably never met a gay couple in their lives. It was a shock to
        them, but my parents love Quinn, so they''ve completely embraced it. They''ve
        even stopped voting in the United States because they lean conservative on
        most issues, but refuses to vote for candidates who don''t fully support the
        LGBQT community because of Quinn. \n\nQuinn is now married to a woman she
        met in law school named Audrey. They actually adopted two little girls a few
        months ago (6F and 2F) who are sisters. I won''t get into details, but they''ve
        been through a lot (their dad was abusive and neglectful), and so it''s been
        a big adjustment for the family. The older daughter has a lot of trauma, but
        Quinn and Audrey are doing everything they can to love and support her. I''m
        honestly so proud of both of them and am enjoying watching them grow their
        family.\n\nAnyways, my cousin Kaitlyn is getting married tomorrow. Quinn,
        Toby, my wife Riley, and Toby''s wife Jamie all flew home for the wedding.
        Audrey stayed home with the girls because they thought the travel and wedding
        was too much for them right now, which we all understand. \n\nNow Kaitlyn
        is a cool person, but her family isn''t my cup of tea. They''re nice to Quinn
        to her face, but I don''t think they necessarily approve of her being married
        to a woman. Kaitlyn''s brother Patrick (36M) used to be close with Quinn,
        but they''ve grown apart over the years. Patrick never went to school, stayed
        in our home town, and hangs out with the same kids he did in high school who
        don''t do much with their lives. He got his high school girlfriend pregnant
        when they were nineteen, and they got married, but break up and get back together
        constantly. Patrick, his wife, and their three boys live with my aunt and
        uncle because Patrick recently got fired from his job. I think he''s insecure
        and jealous of Quinn, and he likes to blame others for why his life hasn''t
        gone the way he imagined. \n\nOn Friday night, the cousins and spouses all
        went to dinner. Quinn was telling everyone about her daughters and showing
        us pictures of them on her phone. Patrick (who was drunk at this point) looked
        annoyed kept rolling his eyes at his wife when Quinn wasn''t looking. At one
        point, Patrick said the girls were adorable, and he''s relieved she and Audrey
        adopted girls and not boys. Quinn asked what he meant, and he said it''s important
        for boys to have a man in the house. Quinn seemed rattled, and the comment
        set me off.\n\nI asked Patrick what a boy could learn from a \"man\" that
        he couldn''t learn from Audrey or Quinn. Patrick started rambling about how
        boys loving throwing the football with their dads and how dads teach their
        sons to be assertive and be \"men.\" He made some other dumb comments too
        along the same lines.\n\nI told Patrick that based on his definition of a
        \"man\", Quinn is more of a man than he is. I said that she was a far better
        athlete than he ever was a DI swimmer and she could teach her son more about
        sports than he ever could as a mediocre high school baseball player. I also
        said that Quinn is a successful attorney in a major U.S. city, and that she
        probably knows more about being \"assertive\" than a grown man living at home
        with his parents and taking no responsibility for his life choices. \n\nI''ll
        note that Quinn and my wife Riley were both laughing and exchanging looks.
        Everyone else was completely shocked. Toby pulled Patrick and his wife aside
        and completely deescalated the situation. This morning, he came into my room
        and told me I should apologize. He said Patrick is going through a hard time
        right now, and I hit below the belt. I said he was being sexist and homophonic
        by insinuating our little sister wasn''t capable of being a good mother to
        a son. Patrick didn''t necessarily disagree, but thinks we should be the bigger
        people and apologize so Kaitlyn has a great wedding. I don''t want to cause
        drama, but also, I have no intention of apologizing. If he''s going to give
        unsolicited opinions about my sister''s ability to parent, I have no issue
        letting him know exactly what I think of him. AITAH?", "author_fullname":

        been trying for a baby for the last three years. Recently, I was diagnosed
        as infertile, and I\u2019ve been struggling to cope with the news. I hadn\u2019t
        told my husband yet because I wasn\u2019t ready to share something so personal
        when I was still processing it myself. The news crushed me, and I felt like
        I needed time to grieve the loss of a future I had envisioned.\n\nI confided
        in my younger sister (30F), who I\u2019ve always been close with, because
        I needed someone to talk to. I made it *very clear* that I wasn\u2019t ready
        for my husband to know yet. I wanted to figure out how to have that difficult
        conversation when I was in a better emotional space. But just days later,
        my husband confronted me in tears, saying my sister had called him to break
        the news. I was furious. I felt completely betrayed by my own sister, someone
        I trusted to respect my boundaries.\n\nWhen I confronted her, she defended
        herself by saying my husband had a right to know and that I was being selfish
        for keeping it from him. She thinks I\u2019m being a \u201cbad wife\u201d
        by withholding something this major, and she claimed that \u201che deserved
        to know the truth\u201d as soon as possible. My husband, meanwhile, is heartbroken
        but agrees with my sister. He\u2019s devastated by the news but says he\u2019s
        glad she told him because he felt it would have been worse if I kept it from
        him any longer. He believes we should face this together.\n\nHere\u2019s where
        it gets even more complicated: I\u2019ve been considering alternative options
        like egg donation or surrogacy, but my husband is *strongly* against these
        due to his religious beliefs. I hadn\u2019t even brought up the topic yet
        because I knew it would lead to a serious conflict. I needed time to weigh
        my options before discussing it with him. Now, with my sister\u2019s interference,
        I feel like all that decision-making power has been taken away from me. I\u2019m
        backed into a corner.\n\nMy sister keeps insisting she did the right thing
        and has been asking for my forgiveness, but I can\u2019t let go of how she
        overstepped my boundaries. I wanted to protect my marriage by handling this
        delicately, and now I feel like the trust between my husband and me is damaged,
        not by the infertility itself, but by how it came out. My parents think I\u2019m
        being dramatic and that my sister was just trying to help. I\u2019m beginning
        to question if I overreacted, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that something
        was taken from me.\n\nAITA for refusing to forgive her?", "author_fullname":

        "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My (34F) husband (36M)
        and I have been trying for a baby for the last three years. Recently, I was
        diagnosed as infertile, and I\u2019ve been struggling to cope with the news.
        I hadn\u2019t told my husband yet because I wasn\u2019t ready to share something
        so personal when I was still processing it myself. The news crushed me, and
        I felt like I needed time to grieve the loss of a future I had envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
        confided in my younger sister (30F), who I\u2019ve always been close with,
        because I needed someone to talk to. I made it &lt;em&gt;very clear&lt;/em&gt;
        that I wasn\u2019t ready for my husband to know yet. I wanted to figure out
        how to have that difficult conversation when I was in a better emotional space.
        But just days later, my husband confronted me in tears, saying my sister had
        called him to break the news. I was furious. I felt completely betrayed by
        my own sister, someone I trusted to respect my boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When
        I confronted her, she defended herself by saying my husband had a right to
        know and that I was being selfish for keeping it from him. She thinks I\u2019m
        being a \u201cbad wife\u201d by withholding something this major, and she
        claimed that \u201che deserved to know the truth\u201d as soon as possible.
        My husband, meanwhile, is heartbroken but agrees with my sister. He\u2019s
        devastated by the news but says he\u2019s glad she told him because he felt
        it would have been worse if I kept it from him any longer. He believes we
        should face this together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s where it gets
        even more complicated: I\u2019ve been considering alternative options like
        egg donation or surrogacy, but my husband is &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt;
        against these due to his religious beliefs. I hadn\u2019t even brought up
        the topic yet because I knew it would lead to a serious conflict. I needed
        time to weigh my options before discussing it with him. Now, with my sister\u2019s
        interference, I feel like all that decision-making power has been taken away
        from me. I\u2019m backed into a corner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister keeps
        insisting she did the right thing and has been asking for my forgiveness,
        but I can\u2019t let go of how she overstepped my boundaries. I wanted to
        protect my marriage by handling this delicately, and now I feel like the trust
        between my husband and me is damaged, not by the infertility itself, but by
        how it came out. My parents think I\u2019m being dramatic and that my sister
        was just trying to help. I\u2019m beginning to question if I overreacted,
        but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that something was taken from me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA
        for refusing to forgive her?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

        husband John for five years now and we have two daughters together (3F and
        1F).\n\nI''ll preface this by saying that I had a tough childhood. My father
        was an abusive alcoholic who was violent with my mother, myself, and my two
        little sisters. He passed away when I was in my early twenties, and as horrible
        as it sounds, I was hopeful it would allow my mom and sisters to have better
        lives.\n\nFrom the time I was young, I knew I never wanted to be in such a
        vulnerable situation again. I focused on my career (I''m a lawyer now) and
        married a sweet, dependable man who comes a kind and functional family. I
        want my girls to have happy childhoods and to never feel unsafe in their home.\n\nSadly,
        my youngest sister Lisa (29F) went in the opposite direction. Her only goal
        in life is to marry rich so she doesn''t have to work and can stay home with
        her future kids. The issue is she chooses the worst guys. Her high school
        boyfriend was controlling, her next boyfriend was physically abusive, and
        her current boyfriend Ian topped the last one by putting her in the ER twice.\n\nThe
        first time Lisa ended up in the ER, she told me she was leaving Ian. I got
        a call from her a few weeks later telling me they had reconciled and she was
        back in the ER. Again, she told me she''d leave. I was hopeful, but skeptical.
        The prosecutor''s office is brining charges against Ian, but Lisa doesn''t
        want to testify, so they subpoenaed her. I told Lisa she could prevent him
        from harming someone else by being honest about what happened, but she said
        she felt for Ian because he had a bad childhood and wants to change. I know
        Ian is out on bail but can''t legally have any communication with my sister,
        but I was worried they''d see each other anyway.\n\nMy daughter''s third birthday
        was earlier this week. My husband and I had a birthday party for her at our
        home earlier today with our families, close friends, and some of her friends
        from preschool. I was enjoying myself, when I saw Lisa holding hands with
        Ian in my own backyard. I was going to confront him, but my husband told me
        it would escalate things. I ended up taking my girls upstairs and calling
        the cops. I explaining that he violated the court order and was at my home
        with my sister and a house full of children.\n\nThe cops came and arrested
        Ian, and my sister started screaming that I drive drunk with my kids all the
        time so they should arrest me too. To be clear, I would never do this. I told
        my sister to leave, and we ended the party early. I was sad for my daughter
        and also humiliated this happened in front of her friends, their parents,
        and my in-laws. I also feel immense guilt that I invited children to my home,
        and they were exposed to a violent predator.\n\nMy mother stayed behind after
        everyone left and screamed at me for calling the police. I explained I didn''t
        know what else to do because there was a predator in my home, around a bunch
        of innocent children. I would have never invited Lisa if I knew she was going
        to bring him. My mom said that he hurt Lisa, not children, and I said that
        abusive boyfriends take their anger out on bystanders all the time. I told
        my mom I don''t think I''ll ever forgive Lisa for putting my children in that
        position, and she told me I should be trying to help my sister through a difficult
        time rather than turning my back on her.\n\nMy MIL ended up coming back about
        an hour after I left the party. She''s a former prosecutor, and was upset
        about the situation. She said she was fearful that Ian knows where I live,
        especially now that I called the police on him. She said that we should stay
        with them if he gets out on bail until things cool down. I thanked my MIL,
        and told her about the conversation with my mom. She agreed with me, and said
        Lisa put my family and all the children at that party in a dangerous situation.\n\nI
        want to be clear that I have sympathy for Lisa I and hate that she''s in this
        position. With that being said, I can''t risk my children''s safety because
        I feel sorry for what she''s going through. She put my kids in danger after
        I worked so hard to try and give them a happy, safe childhood. I don''t know
        if I''ll ever forgive her. AITAH for calling the cops and am I overreacting?",

        just for this - I have a main account I use for my art. I don''t really know
        how to post on this sub though, so please excuse any mistakes - also I think
        it''s important to give a TW as this had violence and death involved and I
        know from personal experience that it can be triggering:\n\nSo, I (F32, Deanna)
        am the eldest of five siblings, and I\u2019ve taken on the role of the family
        caretaker for as long as I can remember. I helped our parents until their
        passing, and, frankly, it\u2019s exhausting. Dad died of brain cancer 3 years
        ago, and it was heartbreaking to watch him deteriorate over time, and Mom
        passed peacefully overnight after a long hard battle with breast cancer earlier
        this year.\n\nFUCK cancer.\n\nSo as the oldest, I just sort of became the
        de-facto parent. I don''t mind as I love my siblings, and its kind of my thing
        to \"big sister\" friends and family a lot. I''m sort of ship''s counselor,
        and I financially help out my family. I don''t mind, as I work in tech, have
        a side gig doing art, and inherited land and money from mom and dad- all that
        to say it''s no real loss.\n\nA few years ago, I adopted my cousin\u2019s
        \"Charlie\" M45 child who I will just use her nickname \"Decker\" (my baby
        loves kickboxing) after my cousin went to prison for murdering the Decker''s
        mother in an alcohol and drug-fueled rage - which is too long a story to add
        here. It was a chaotic year of mourning, paperwork and court hearings, but
        the adoption was finalized when the Decker was five. Now, she\u2019s a happy,
        healthy 13-year-old who calls me \u201cMom.\u201d She\u2019s in therapy, and
        has been since I legally could send her as she witnessed her mother''s death,
        and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of how resilient she is. She''s my girl, my
        rock-star, my whole heart and I call her that - literally \"My heart\".\n\nFast
        forward to my sister\u2019s, Clara (F30), upcoming wedding. I was thrilled
        for her at first, and she asked me to be MOH. I cried in joy and offered for
        my wife \"Honey\" (because we like The Incredible lol) F40 and I to pay for
        it (don''t worry I asked Honey first). \n\nBut during a bachelorette dinner
        I set up, she made a hurtful comment about my daughter, calling her a \u201cmistake\u201d
        and saying I \u201cshouldn\u2019t have taken her in.\u201d I stared at her
        and asked her what she meant and she said it wasn''t like I was supposed to
        even have kids, as I am married to another woman - then said \"no hate or
        anything\" and laughed but then she doubled down that Decker is likely damaged
        and a handful.\n\nGuys, Decker is the SWEETEST child alive. I mean she is
        a teen so yeah sometimes she can get challenging or rebellious here or there,
        but when I say she is my WHOLE heart, I mean it. She made us a family, and
        made our house a home. She smiles easy, cries openly and has the emotional
        intelligence I WISH I had myself. She always asks \"how are you doing?\" and
        she really means it, willing to listen to people. But she''s a \"damaged\"
        \"mistake\"!? \n\n I felt like a character in a dark, twisted episode of a
        sci-fi show\u2014defending my choice to adopt felt like fighting the Borg,
        like I just wouldn\u2019t assimilate. I didn''t laugh it off with my sister
        and her friends. I just stared at her in pure disbelief. I think she knew
        I was hurt because she quickly changed the subject. I said I better get home,
        paid for everything and 3 more rounds and went home to my family. \n\nMy sister
        came over the next day to yell at me for leaving and \"cutting them off\"
        after the 3 rounds I paid for. She said I owe her a do-over for ruining the
        whole weekend because I can''t take a joke. Honey, who I of course told what
        happened, asked my sister to repeat exactly what she said about our daughter.
        My sister refused, and kept calling Decker \"Charlie''s child\" and I just
        was holding back so many tears.  I told my sister that I wouldn\u2019t be
        contributing a dime to her wedding expenses - that I won''t stop helping her
        pay her rent up until she moves in with her husband, but I won''t be in or
        pay for the wedding of a person who sees my child as a mistake. \n\nHonestly,
        I was ready to go full-on Jedi and sever that connection but Honey helped
        me temper myself. My sister lost it, threw the can of soda water we gave her
        at me, screamed \"How am I supposed to pay for this!?\" and I said, \"You
        have over a year, you can save up.\" - so left, showving Honey out of the
        way in the process and blew up our sibling group chat. My other siblings are
        split. Some think I\u2019m overreacting with cutting off funds for the wedding,
        while others agree that my sister crossed a line and needed the wake up call.\n\nNow,
        I feel bad for my sister - I do love her and she is distressed by this - but
        I can\u2019t shake the feeling that standing up for my daughter is more important.
        AITA for refusing to pay for her wedding after that?\n\n_____\nI am adding
        this in edit option -\n\nI''ve been working on my work project at a local
        brewery and have been silently sobbing in reading the comments. \n\nAlso wow
        so many comments! I was trying to reply to everyone but I honestly ran out
        of steam. I sent this post to my wife and also just bracing myself to talk
        to Decker tonight. We want to ask her of her aunt has done or said anything
        cruel to or about her. I am wishing hard that shes just confused by our questions
        and remain oblivious of this shitstorm. \n\nI love my Heart. I want her to
        always remain the bright, fun, loving, encouraging person she is. I don''t
        want her to know anything about what her aunt has said.  I texted my sister
        if she meant this, if she really sees me, my wife, and our daughter that way
        or was she just drunk and stupid and doubled down in embarrassment. That said,
        I don''t want her near Decker anytime soon. \n\nI feel so lost. I wasn''t
        planning on ever being a parent and there is no fucking manual for this. What
        the fuck do I even do??\n\nWish me luck for tonight. I will need it because
        if Decker tells us her aunt has been cruel to her face, I will have to hold
        my wife back from swinging on my sister. ", "author_fullname": "t2_19r35wfwv5",

        "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, guys, so I created
        a profile just for this - I have a main account I use for my art. I don&amp;#39;t
        really know how to post on this sub though, so please excuse any mistakes
        - also I think it&amp;#39;s important to give a TW as this had violence and
        death involved and I know from personal experience that it can be triggering:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So,
        I (F32, Deanna) am the eldest of five siblings, and I\u2019ve taken on the
        role of the family caretaker for as long as I can remember. I helped our parents
        until their passing, and, frankly, it\u2019s exhausting. Dad died of brain
        cancer 3 years ago, and it was heartbreaking to watch him deteriorate over
        time, and Mom passed peacefully overnight after a long hard battle with breast
        cancer earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FUCK cancer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So
        as the oldest, I just sort of became the de-facto parent. I don&amp;#39;t
        mind as I love my siblings, and its kind of my thing to &amp;quot;big sister&amp;quot;
        friends and family a lot. I&amp;#39;m sort of ship&amp;#39;s counselor, and
        I financially help out my family. I don&amp;#39;t mind, as I work in tech,
        have a side gig doing art, and inherited land and money from mom and dad-
        all that to say it&amp;#39;s no real loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few years
        ago, I adopted my cousin\u2019s &amp;quot;Charlie&amp;quot; M45 child who
        I will just use her nickname &amp;quot;Decker&amp;quot; (my baby loves kickboxing)
        after my cousin went to prison for murdering the Decker&amp;#39;s mother in
        an alcohol and drug-fueled rage - which is too long a story to add here. It
        was a chaotic year of mourning, paperwork and court hearings, but the adoption
        was finalized when the Decker was five. Now, she\u2019s a happy, healthy 13-year-old
        who calls me \u201cMom.\u201d She\u2019s in therapy, and has been since I
        legally could send her as she witnessed her mother&amp;#39;s death, and I
        couldn\u2019t be prouder of how resilient she is. She&amp;#39;s my girl, my
        rock-star, my whole heart and I call her that - literally &amp;quot;My heart&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast
        forward to my sister\u2019s, Clara (F30), upcoming wedding. I was thrilled
        for her at first, and she asked me to be MOH. I cried in joy and offered for
        my wife &amp;quot;Honey&amp;quot; (because we like The Incredible lol) F40
        and I to pay for it (don&amp;#39;t worry I asked Honey first). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But
        during a bachelorette dinner I set up, she made a hurtful comment about my
        daughter, calling her a \u201cmistake\u201d and saying I \u201cshouldn\u2019t
        have taken her in.\u201d I stared at her and asked her what she meant and
        she said it wasn&amp;#39;t like I was supposed to even have kids, as I am
        married to another woman - then said &amp;quot;no hate or anything&amp;quot;
        and laughed but then she doubled down that Decker is likely damaged and a
        handful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guys, Decker is the SWEETEST child alive. I
        mean she is a teen so yeah sometimes she can get challenging or rebellious
        here or there, but when I say she is my WHOLE heart, I mean it. She made us
        a family, and made our house a home. She smiles easy, cries openly and has
        the emotional intelligence I WISH I had myself. She always asks &amp;quot;how
        are you doing?&amp;quot; and she really means it, willing to listen to people.
        But she&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;damaged&amp;quot; &amp;quot;mistake&amp;quot;!?
        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt like a character in a dark, twisted episode
        of a sci-fi show\u2014defending my choice to adopt felt like fighting the
        Borg, like I just wouldn\u2019t assimilate. I didn&amp;#39;t laugh it off

        I went on the date with knows my original Reddit.\n\nI (32yo male) recently
        got back into dating apps because I have been feeling confident about my body.
        Most dating apps for gay men have gotten superficial (for the most part) and
        I wanted to try my shot again since I\u2019ve been going to the gym and eating
        healthier. For the first couple of weeks, I\u2019d get random guys who I found
        attractive OR blank profiles who were afraid to show their face OR guys who
        just sent their dicks. I ignore most of them because I\u2019m ready to settle
        down and find a boyfriend.\n\nI finally get one guy (34 - we\u2019ll call
        him Blake) who matched with me on Tinder. Blake and I went on our first date
        a couple weeks ago. When I first met him, I got this vibe that he was \u201cstraight
        acting\u201d because of trauma he faced growing up. At first the date felt
        genuine. I asked him about what he likes, he\u2019d ask me the same. I did,
        however, noticed he would smile, but cover his face like he just heard a funny
        joke. He\u2019d laugh it off, then go back to asking me questions. I\u2019d
        answer and ask him questions. I offered a second date to see if he genuinely
        liked me, and he said he\u2019d do it only if we weren\u2019t in public. I
        thought \u201cweird, but okay.\u201d Maybe he\u2019s different in private.
        I wanted to give him a hug, but before I even thought about it, he was already
        heading to the parking lot to his car.\n\nWe had our second date a couple
        days later. He shows up to my house (big mistake on my end), but he was acting
        nervous - almost skittish. He was short with me, barely made conversation,
        stayed on his phone, and every other second he had to go to the bathroom.
        The whole conversation we had was weird, too. He asked me how many guys or
        women I\u2019ve been with, then he\u2019d ask me if I\u2019d top or bottom.
        It was almost like he was fishing for something. It was like everything I\u2019d
        say was a joke and he had to go to the bathroom after the conversations. At
        this point, I was getting self conscious about the things I\u2019d say or
        how I presented myself. When he came back from the bathroom a fourth time,
        I asked \u201cAre you okay? Are you sick? Did I do something wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d
        he replied. \u201cI just had to go, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nI brushed it
        off like it was nothing. He looked down at his phone and said he \u201chad
        to leave\u201d for an emergency. I was like, \u201cokay, text me later.\u201d
        I just kept thinking something is fishy. But I\u2019m stupid enough to answer
        him when he texts to meet up again.\n\nWe went on one more date, but before
        the date started, I get a message on Facebook from this girl (we\u2019ll call
        her Monica). She messaged me asking if I knew Blake. I told her \u201cyes.
        We\u2019ve been going on dates.\u201d She sent me a couple of pics of the
        two of them together. She told me that I should end things because he\u2019s
        actually dating her. She said his friends made a bet that if one of them could
        get the most \u201cgay dates\u201d they would get $50 from each. I thanked
        her and waited at the diner we were to have the date in. He comes in with
        the same attitude as before. Nervous, skittish, and almost like he was trying
        to prove something. When he sat down, I didn\u2019t hesitate to be upfront
        and ask \u201cWho\u2019s Monica?\u201d He said \u201cA friend.\u201d I looked
        at him and said, \u201cshe might be more of a friend to me, because this date
        is costing you $50, right?\u201d\n\nHis face went flat and he didn\u2019t
        say anything. I didn\u2019t even wait for any food, I just got up and left.\n\nAm
        I the asshole for getting up and leaving? Or did I do the right thing?", "author_fullname":

        car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had our second date a couple days later. He
        shows up to my house (big mistake on my end), but he was acting nervous -
        almost skittish. He was short with me, barely made conversation, stayed on
        his phone, and every other second he had to go to the bathroom. The whole
        conversation we had was weird, too. He asked me how many guys or women I\u2019ve
        been with, then he\u2019d ask me if I\u2019d top or bottom. It was almost
        like he was fishing for something. It was like everything I\u2019d say was
        a joke and he had to go to the bathroom after the conversations. At this point,
        I was getting self conscious about the things I\u2019d say or how I presented
        myself. When he came back from the bathroom a fourth time, I asked \u201cAre
        you okay? Are you sick? Did I do something wrong?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNah,\u201d
        he replied. \u201cI just had to go, that\u2019s all.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
        brushed it off like it was nothing. He looked down at his phone and said he
        \u201chad to leave\u201d for an emergency. I was like, \u201cokay, text me
        later.\u201d I just kept thinking something is fishy. But I\u2019m stupid
        enough to answer him when he texts to meet up again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We
        went on one more date, but before the date started, I get a message on Facebook
        from this girl (we\u2019ll call her Monica). She messaged me asking if I knew
        Blake. I told her \u201cyes. We\u2019ve been going on dates.\u201d She sent
        me a couple of pics of the two of them together. She told me that I should
        end things because he\u2019s actually dating her. She said his friends made
        a bet that if one of them could get the most \u201cgay dates\u201d they would
        get $50 from each. I thanked her and waited at the diner we were to have the
        date in. He comes in with the same attitude as before. Nervous, skittish,
        and almost like he was trying to prove something. When he sat down, I didn\u2019t
        hesitate to be upfront and ask \u201cWho\u2019s Monica?\u201d He said \u201cA
        friend.\u201d I looked at him and said, \u201cshe might be more of a friend
        to me, because this date is costing you $50, right?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His
        face went flat and he didn\u2019t say anything. I didn\u2019t even wait for
        any food, I just got up and left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I the asshole for
        getting up and leaving? Or did I do the right thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

        null, "subreddit": "AITAH", "selftext": "So, I have been in a relationship
        with my boyfriend, Jake, for about three years. We have two kids together,
        and we\u2019ve always talked about saving for their college education. For
        the last year, we\u2019ve been putting money aside, and we finally had a decent
        amount saved up\u2014around $15,000.\n\nRecently, I noticed Jake was acting
        a bit off. He was secretive about his phone, spending more time out with friends,
        and seemed to be coming home a little tipsy more often than usual. I brushed
        it off at first, thinking maybe he was just going through a phase or needed
        a break from the stress of parenting.\n\nThen one night, I came home early
        from work and found him passed out on the couch. When I went to check on him,
        I saw receipts scattered on the coffee table\u2014bar tabs, restaurant bills,
        and, worst of all, a receipt for a local casino. I felt my heart drop when
        I noticed a withdrawal slip for a significant amount from our savings account.\n\nI
        confronted him about it the next morning, and he admitted that he had been
        using our college savings to fund his drinking and gambling. He said he thought
        he could win it back and didn\u2019t want to burden me with his struggles.
        I was devastated. We had always agreed that our kids\u2019 education was a
        priority, and this felt like a huge betrayal.\n\nAfter a few days of deliberation,
        I made the tough decision to break up with him. I told him that I couldn\u2019t
        be with someone who would prioritize drinking and gambling over our children\u2019s
        future. He begged me to reconsider, saying he would change, but I felt like

        "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I have been in
        a relationship with my boyfriend, Jake, for about three years. We have two
        kids together, and we\u2019ve always talked about saving for their college
        education. For the last year, we\u2019ve been putting money aside, and we
        finally had a decent amount saved up\u2014around $15,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently,
        I noticed Jake was acting a bit off. He was secretive about his phone, spending
        more time out with friends, and seemed to be coming home a little tipsy more
        often than usual. I brushed it off at first, thinking maybe he was just going
        through a phase or needed a break from the stress of parenting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then
        one night, I came home early from work and found him passed out on the couch.
        When I went to check on him, I saw receipts scattered on the coffee table\u2014bar
        tabs, restaurant bills, and, worst of all, a receipt for a local casino. I
        felt my heart drop when I noticed a withdrawal slip for a significant amount
        from our savings account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I confronted him about it
        the next morning, and he admitted that he had been using our college savings
        to fund his drinking and gambling. He said he thought he could win it back
        and didn\u2019t want to burden me with his struggles. I was devastated. We
        had always agreed that our kids\u2019 education was a priority, and this felt
        like a huge betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few days of deliberation,
        I made the tough decision to break up with him. I told him that I couldn\u2019t
        be with someone who would prioritize drinking and gambling over our children\u2019s
        future. He begged me to reconsider, saying he would change, but I felt like
        I couldn\u2019t trust him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I\u2019m dealing
        with a lot of guilt. I know breaking up is hard on everyone, especially the
        kids, but I also feel it\u2019s necessary for our family\u2019s stability.
        Some of my friends think I did the right thing, while others say I should
        have tried to help him instead of walking away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA
        for breaking up with my boyfriend after he drained our college savings for
        drinking and gambling? I found out my boyfriend spent our college savings
        on drinking and gambling, so I broke up with him. Now I feel guilty and uncertain
        if I made the right choice. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
