        I can barely type this out. It\u2019s a degenerative illness, no cure, nothing.
        My body\u2019s just gonna slowly get worse. And the kicker? My parents have
        known this could happen my *whole* life and never said a damn word.\n\nThis
        illness runs in my family. My dad\u2019s *mom* had it. His *sister*\u2014my
        aunt\u2014died from it a few years ago. I was living overseas when she passed,
        and my parents told me it was cancer. *Cancer.* They lied right to my face.
        It wasn\u2019t until I got diagnosed that they *finally* came clean and admitted
        she had the same illness I do. When I confronted them, my dad wouldn\u2019t
        even give me a straight answer. I asked if he had it too, and he dodged every
        single question, acting like I was overreacting.\n\nMy mom, on the other hand,
        tried to justify it by saying they didn\u2019t want me \u201cliving in fear.\u201d
        Are you kidding me? I could have been *prepared*! Instead, they chose to let
        me walk into this blind. And here\u2019s where it gets worse\u2014I have a
        2-year-old son. My child might have this, and they *never* told me I was at
        risk. I could\u2019ve had him tested, made informed decisions, *anything*.
        But no, they took that from me, and now I live in constant fear for him too.\n\nThen
        my mom had the *nerve* to ask *me* if I would have rather not been born than
        deal with this. Can you believe that? She turned it around on me, like *I\u2019m*
        the monster for even thinking it. And you know what? Yes, I said it. *Yes,
        I would rather not have been born* than deal with this disease. They made
        a selfish choice, and now *I\u2019m* paying for it. They knew the risks and
        did it anyway, for *themselves*. They wanted kids, and now I\u2019m stuck
        with this. I called them selfish, and I meant every word.\n\nNow, they\u2019re
        *begging* me not to tell my younger siblings. They don\u2019t know about this
        yet, haven\u2019t been tested, and my parents want to keep it that way. They\u2019re
        hoping they\u2019ll get lucky, but I\u2019m not going to lie to them. I refuse
        to let them be blindsided like I was. They deserve to know the truth.\n\nI\u2019ve
        gone low contact with my parents. I can\u2019t stand to even think about them
        right now. My mom keeps trying to guilt-trip me, saying they were \u201cjust
        trying to protect me.\u201d Protect me from *what*? The truth? No, they weren\u2019t
        protecting me. They were protecting *themselves*, from the guilt of knowing
        they passed this on, and now they want me to protect them too. But I won\u2019t.
        I love my son and my siblings too much to lie to them.\n\nAITA for going LC

        5 year old isn''t biologically mine, I felt so hurt and betrayed that my wife
        of 6 years relationship for 9 cheated on me and even got pregnant by another
        man, I took a paternity test without telling my wife \n\nI immediately confronted
        my wife and called her a whore in my anger and many other names, she started
        crying and explained that she hid it because she didn''t want to break our
        happy family of 3, I asked her why did she cheat on me, she explained we had
        a very nasty argument back in the day so she hooked up with someone and it
        was just one time fling and has been loyal to me \n\nShe said she had doubts
        that I wouldn''t be the father but she never took paternity she said she was
        happy seeing me happy and didn''t go with abortion for peace of our family
        and didn''t tell me the truth \n\nI told her I am divorcing and I don''t want
        to be in our son''s life, she started crying and begging me to not break the
        family and I am still his father and I have been a wonderful father and a
        husband I should forgive her and don''t let ''dna'' Destroy our lives and
        started begging me \n\nI immediately left and she was blowing up my phone,
        I decided at first not to tell anyone else but in the end I got very angry
        and decided to tell everyone, everyone is pissed at my wife \n\nHer parents
        said they want nothing to do with their daughter and cut contact, my sister
        furiously called my soon to be ex and cursed her out, her brother and sister
        on the other hand said I have humiliated my soon to be ex and shouldn''t have
        told everyone and should have kept in between us\n\nYesterday her sister called
        me and said I need to take her back and come back for my son, I said I don''t
        have a son, she got angry and started cursing me and said I am a weak pathetic
        man no wonder my wife cheated on me and I am so pathetic I had to go behind
        my wife''s back to take paternity cause I am  insecure and weak that I am
        giving up on my son just because we don''t share blood and I am the reason
        my wife is alone and depressed\n\nI cut her call instead I called her husband
        and told him everything, i said that family is full of nutjobs, maybe it runs
        in their blood you should take a paternity as well and don''t trust those
        bitches, he said he''s sorry on his wife''s behalf and we ended the call\n\nNow

        her sister called me and said I need to take her back and come back for my
        son, I said I don&amp;#39;t have a son, she got angry and started cursing
        me and said I am a weak pathetic man no wonder my wife cheated on me and I
        am so pathetic I had to go behind my wife&amp;#39;s back to take paternity
        cause I am  insecure and weak that I am giving up on my son just because we
        don&amp;#39;t share blood and I am the reason my wife is alone and depressed&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
        cut her call instead I called her husband and told him everything, i said
        that family is full of nutjobs, maybe it runs in their blood you should take
        a paternity as well and don&amp;#39;t trust those bitches, he said he&amp;#39;s
        sorry on his wife&amp;#39;s behalf and we ended the call&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now
        I am ignoring all my wife&amp;#39;s and that bitch&amp;#39;s calls&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

        I can barely type this out. It\u2019s a degenerative illness, no cure, nothing.
        My body\u2019s just gonna slowly get worse. And the kicker? My parents have
        known this could happen my *whole* life and never said a damn word.\n\nThis
        illness runs in my family. My dad\u2019s *mom* had it. His *sister*\u2014my
        aunt\u2014died from it a few years ago. I was living overseas when she passed,
        and my parents told me it was cancer. *Cancer.* They lied right to my face.

        she had the same illness I do. When I confronted them, my dad wouldn\u2019t
        even give me a straight answer. I asked if he had it too, and he dodged every
        single question, acting like I was overreacting.\n\nMy mom, on the other hand,
        tried to justify it by saying they didn\u2019t want me \u201cliving in fear.\u201d
        Are you kidding me? I could have been *prepared*! Instead, they chose to let
        me walk into this blind. And here\u2019s where it gets worse\u2014I have a
        2-year-old son. My child might have this, and they *never* told me I was at
        risk. I could\u2019ve had him tested, made informed decisions, *anything*.
        But no, they took that from me, and now I live in constant fear for him too.\n\nThen
        my mom had the *nerve* to ask *me* if I would have rather not been born than
        deal with this. Can you believe that? She turned it around on me, like *I\u2019m*
        the monster for even thinking it. And you know what? Yes, I said it. *Yes,
        I would rather not have been born* than deal with this disease. They made
        a selfish choice, and now *I\u2019m* paying for it. They knew the risks and
        did it anyway, for *themselves*. They wanted kids, and now I\u2019m stuck
        with this. I called them selfish, and I meant every word.\n\nNow, they\u2019re
        *begging* me not to tell my younger siblings. They don\u2019t know about this
        yet, haven\u2019t been tested, and my parents want to keep it that way. They\u2019re
        hoping they\u2019ll get lucky, but I\u2019m not going to lie to them. I refuse
        to let them be blindsided like I was. They deserve to know the truth.\n\nI\u2019ve
        gone low contact with my parents. I can\u2019t stand to even think about them
        right now. My mom keeps trying to guilt-trip me, saying they were \u201cjust
        trying to protect me.\u201d Protect me from *what*? The truth? No, they weren\u2019t
        protecting me. They were protecting *themselves*, from the guilt of knowing
        they passed this on, and now they want me to protect them too. But I won\u2019t.
        I love my son and my siblings too much to lie to them.\n\nAITA for going LC

        I would have rather not been born than deal with this. Can you believe that?
        She turned it around on me, like &lt;em&gt;I\u2019m&lt;/em&gt; the monster
        for even thinking it. And you know what? Yes, I said it. &lt;em&gt;Yes, I
        would rather not have been born&lt;/em&gt; than deal with this disease. They
        made a selfish choice, and now &lt;em&gt;I\u2019m&lt;/em&gt; paying for it.
        They knew the risks and did it anyway, for &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt;.
        They wanted kids, and now I\u2019m stuck with this. I called them selfish,
        and I meant every word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, they\u2019re &lt;em&gt;begging&lt;/em&gt;
        me not to tell my younger siblings. They don\u2019t know about this yet, haven\u2019t
        been tested, and my parents want to keep it that way. They\u2019re hoping
        they\u2019ll get lucky, but I\u2019m not going to lie to them. I refuse to
        let them be blindsided like I was. They deserve to know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve
        gone low contact with my parents. I can\u2019t stand to even think about them
        right now. My mom keeps trying to guilt-trip me, saying they were \u201cjust
        trying to protect me.\u201d Protect me from &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;? The
        truth? No, they weren\u2019t protecting me. They were protecting &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt;,
        from the guilt of knowing they passed this on, and now they want me to protect
        them too. But I won\u2019t. I love my son and my siblings too much to lie
        to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA for going LC and refusing to keep their
        secret, even though they claim they were just trying to \u201cprotect\u201d
        me?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort":

        get Huntington''s. But the more repeats you have, the earlier the onset and
        the more severe the disease. Once you have over the threshold for disease,
        the repeat typically becomes unstable, and when making copies for new cells,
        more repeats can be added. This isn''t an issue for the individual themselves

        My parents did the same to me &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; and Im terminally
        ill at 24 years old from not being able to or even having the knowledge to
        try to offset the effects of my conditions. It was selfish at all to breed,
        at least in my case, and not only that but my parents kept me and everyone
        else in the dark about it. It wasnt even that I wasnt seeking care/answers.
        Ive been very unwell and wonky all my life and started seeing doctors for
        it regularly by 7. By middle school I was very aware something was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;
        wrong and doctors didnt know either so would bandaid slap it all. I needed
        surgeries and treatments I never got bc everyone denied there was a bigger

        disclosing this kind of stuff early, means you set up a kid to think they&amp;#39;re
        going to have a normal life when in reality they are definitely not, as they
        will probably have family members with it and also have whiplash if they find
        out they have it themselves. As it also affects your mental health as mood
        swings are one of the symptoms, it&amp;#39;s also shit because you may have
        no idea why something is happening and get misdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        5 year old isn''t biologically mine, I felt so hurt and betrayed that my wife
        of 6 years relationship for 9 cheated on me and even got pregnant by another
        man, I took a paternity test without telling my wife \n\nI immediately confronted
        my wife and called her a whore in my anger and many other names, she started
        crying and explained that she hid it because she didn''t want to break our
        happy family of 3, I asked her why did she cheat on me, she explained we had
        a very nasty argument back in the day so she hooked up with someone and it
        was just one time fling and has been loyal to me \n\nShe said she had doubts
        that I wouldn''t be the father but she never took paternity she said she was
        happy seeing me happy and didn''t go with abortion for peace of our family
        and didn''t tell me the truth \n\nI told her I am divorcing and I don''t want
        to be in our son''s life, she started crying and begging me to not break the
        family and I am still his father and I have been a wonderful father and a
        husband I should forgive her and don''t let ''dna'' Destroy our lives and
        started begging me \n\nI immediately left and she was blowing up my phone,
        I decided at first not to tell anyone else but in the end I got very angry
        and decided to tell everyone, everyone is pissed at my wife \n\nHer parents
        said they want nothing to do with their daughter and cut contact, my sister
        furiously called my soon to be ex and cursed her out, her brother and sister
        on the other hand said I have humiliated my soon to be ex and shouldn''t have
        told everyone and should have kept in between us\n\nYesterday her sister called
        me and said I need to take her back and come back for my son, I said I don''t
        have a son, she got angry and started cursing me and said I am a weak pathetic
        man no wonder my wife cheated on me and I am so pathetic I had to go behind
        my wife''s back to take paternity cause I am  insecure and weak that I am
        giving up on my son just because we don''t share blood and I am the reason
        my wife is alone and depressed\n\nI cut her call instead I called her husband
        and told him everything, i said that family is full of nutjobs, maybe it runs
        in their blood you should take a paternity as well and don''t trust those
        bitches, he said he''s sorry on his wife''s behalf and we ended the call\n\nNow
